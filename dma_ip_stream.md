# DMA with Stream based IP

## Description

This code is pretty much the same with the tutorial from PYNQ tutorial written by Cathal McCabe from AMD.
https://discuss.pynq.io/t/tutorial-using-a-hls-stream-ip-with-dma-part-2-vivado-design/3345/1

The important part is the set up the Vivado block design correctly. The block connection is slightly different with the PYNQ-Z1 tutorial.
I put the tutorial here just to prevent I forget how to do it.

Visit the folder /HW_HLS/dma_ip_stream for more details. You can find out the connection of the block design and the parameters setting of the IP.
